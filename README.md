# morse_coder
Morse Code Translator for Raspberry Pi

I am using the NEW raspberry pi 4 (4GB) for this project.

Step 1:
Attach a audio device, I am using a buzzer, positive (5v) to GPIO pin 26 (board # 37) and ground (pin 39 is nice).

Step 2:
Be sure your running python 3.6 or+ ($ python --version)

Final Step:
Run it, enter word / letter / number (not case sensitive) and enjoy!

NOTE** at this point it will break if a non-letter or numbers are used. NO PUNCUATION ALLOWED... yet.
